## Overview of Project
Steve, whom I am helping, wishes to analyze the entire stock market over the past few years. This project uses VBA in Excel to gather the Total Daily Volume for each stock in our given data set and determine the percentage of return and whether that return is a positive or negative amount. Additionally, I tested the efficiency of the VBA code to determine the total run time to analyze the stocks data set for 2017 and 2018.
